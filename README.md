  The aim of this exercise is to design and write a code to pass all tests.
  
  A train is made of different types of wagons: head, passenger, restaurant,
  and cargo. Each type has its specific representation: - Head : <HHHH if its
  the last wagon HHHH> if it is the first wagon - Passenger : |OOOO| -
  Restaurant : |hThT| - A cargo wagon can be either empty or loaded - If empty
  its represented as |____| - If loaded: its represented as |^^^^|
  
   The wagons are connected by "::"

This java application contains three main parts:
  
  1-a model-containing package to define all models related to a train

  2- a package to define constants and all helper methods  

  3- a last one which contains the main class
